This small extension provides a new module type ('*Article as module*') so you can use articles as module e.g. in your page layout.

Usually you would need to use InsertTags and find the articles ID or alias to do something like this. Now you can simply pick the article you want from a dropdown and the rest will be done automatically.

## Features
* New module type: Article as module
* pick your desired article and use the module where ever you want
